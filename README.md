# Ari Lamstein's Census Mapping Course

## Martin's lessons

This is a repo with the code for my work as part of Ari Lamstein's free course, 
"Learn to Map Census Data in R". 

The course gives hands-on experience using the R package `choroplethr`(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/choroplethr/index.html)

The data that is mapped comes from the United States Census Bureau's [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/). 

For more info on the course, please see Ari Lamstein's page [www.arilamstein.com](http://www.arilamstein.com/)
