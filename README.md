# Ari Lamstein's Census Mapping Course

## Martin's lessons

This is a repo with the code for my work as part of Ari Lamstein's free course, 
"Learn to Map Census Data in R". 

The course uses data from the United States Census Bureau's [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/). 

For more info on the course, please see Ari Lamstein's page [www.arilamstein.com](http://www.arilamstein.com/)
